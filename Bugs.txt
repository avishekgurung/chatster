3. Sometimes, the message is sent three times. It normally happens when in debug mode in the server side

4. Message sent from different guest but same browser. When page refreshed in agent, same guest email appears.

5. Connection.count sometimes goes haywired. Make few guest connections. Close the agent window, now close the guest window. THe connection count will be in negative.
